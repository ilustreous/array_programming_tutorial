Problem set
===========

1. Compute the standard deviation by symbol, using the 
   closing prices array.

   - Imperative style
   - Array Style

**Without using numpy's standard deviation function**

Bonus
-----

1. Compute the standard deviation using the
   array style as a "one-liner".


2. Verify your answer by comparing it against
   numpy's builtin standard deviation function 
   (also as a one-liner if you can).
