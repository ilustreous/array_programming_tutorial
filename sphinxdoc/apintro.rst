Introduction

Structure
=========
Tutorial is structured after the 
`Learn Python the Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org>`_ way.
But given the time constraints I set up an interactive demo that where
we can explore the results at the ipython_ REPL (read-eval-print loop).



Concepts
========
Inter-mixed

- IPython

- numpy/scipy stack (90%)

  - compare contrast between

    - imperative programming

    - sql programming

- matplotlib (5%)

- cpu/memory profiling (5%)
