Numpy

Numpy is the python package for processing numerical arrays.

- History

  - 1995: **Numeric** -  It wraps efficient and proven C and FORTRAN libraries.

  - 2005 **numarray** -  Filled holes from Numeric

  - 2006 **Numpy** - Combined the two (95% Numeric though)

    - Lead Developer - `Travis Oliphant <http://technicaldiscovery.blogspot.com/>`_

- Adoption
   
  - India's `National Mission <http://fossee.in/>`_ is to spread the adoption of 
    open source tools the top being python/numpy/scipy to all students
    (started in 09').

  - Microsoft less than a year a go ported numpy/scipy into `IronPython <http://pytools.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=NumPy%20and%20SciPy%20for%20.Net>`_

    - May have some other motives but they value in this space

  - AQR Capital - hedge fund in chicago built a stack on top of numpy called `pandas <https://github.com/wesm/pandas>`_ for timeseries data
   
  - Matlab views numpy/scipy as a true competitor

    - I was on a conference call with some programmers at matlab trying to uncover a memory problem we were having
    - They told me that python is one of their leading competitors for market
      share
