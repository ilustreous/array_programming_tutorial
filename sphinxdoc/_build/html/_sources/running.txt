****************
Spin up workflow
****************

This document is meant to give a brief tutorial on using the workflow inside of ipython.


cd to workspace
===============

*cd* to your workspace tree using a command terminal: 

windows: ``\\susq\eot\sotbktst\scratch\{username}\ws\{name_of_workspace}``

linux: ``/eot/sotbktst/scratch/{usrname}/ws/name_of_workspace``

|more| If you haven't pulled down the source code please see vist the :ref:`depot` tutorial.


Source settings
===============

Run the command (this should be run everytime you want to use workflow)::

    $ . workflow.setup.sh

or if in windows::

    > workflow.setup.bat


running those scripts will setup the correct paths for sigtoolchain, python and condor.

Run ipython/spyder
==================

Run this command to start up ipython::

    $ ipython -pylab -p btsh


or in windows start up spyder::

   > spyder


Spyder is a scientific python development environment, akin to matlab (but free). 
This will be the tool to use while on windows. It has an embedded console that
runs ipython, an advanced editor, a history of commands and much more.
You can check out more about it here: http://packages.python.org/spyder/
