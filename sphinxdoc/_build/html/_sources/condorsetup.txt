Credentials
============
Our bt cluster is a mix of windows and linux machines.
In order to run on windows machines you must store your
nt credentials on btsotbal501 (windows machine).

Using your nt username and password log into btsotbal501.

Run this command in a terminal::
    
    > c:\condor\bin\condor_store_cred.exe add

NT users will be asked to change their password every three months.
After doing that, you need to reset your credentials on btsotbal501 too.
