- strided is better than scattered
- contiguous is better than strided
- descriptive is better than imperative (e.g. data-types)
- array-oriented is often better than object-oriented
- broadcasting is a great idea -- use where possible
- vectorized is better than an explicit loop
- unless itâ€™s complicated --- then use Cython or numexpr
- think in higher dimensions
